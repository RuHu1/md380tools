The display of my TYT MD380 is upside down after replacing the old display.
It was broken. After switching on the device, the display was in the display head. 180 degrees twisted.
So I tested a few things. I flash the Software Version 13.14 and everything is OK. Display orientation OK and normal.
When I Flash a newer version (13.20 or 13.34) or the md380tools version, the display is back on its head. 
All displays and functions work normally. 
Does anyone have an idea here to fix it?
